I did only two first tasks.

I didn't understood third task - what would be the "file contents" in case of merging files?

I started fourth task but didn't finish because I didn't have time. If there isn't some specific deadline I can finish it next week. (I got some freelance job to do this week).

Tasks are committed like "folder trees", and all you need to do is copy and paste content of main folders into magento installation (1.9.3.0).

For second task there is also a query that need to be executed.

I am kind of on beginner level in git and magento so please excuse me for any "obvious" mistakes i did.
